This is a practice repository for learning Git workflows. I have written some facts about Venus and Mercury for you to see.
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun!
Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system!

Our solar system is made up of eight unique planets that orbit the Sun, each with its own physical characteristics, atmosphere, and behavior. The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky and relatively small, while the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are much larger and composed mostly of gas or ice. These planets vary widely in temperature, rotation speed, gravity, and composition, ranging from the extreme heat of Venus to the powerful storms of Jupiter and the icy winds of Neptune. Studying the planets helps us better understand how solar systems form, how Earth compares to its neighbors, and where conditions for life might exist elsewhere in the universe.
