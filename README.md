# 🌍 Planets Database

## Overview
This repository is a practice project created to learn the basics of Git and GitHub workflows. It contains a simple, text-based database of information about planets in our solar system. The goal of this project is not the scientific accuracy of the data, but to practice creating repositories, organizing files, making commits, and syncing changes with GitHub.

This repository was created as part of a Git and GitHub learning assignment.

## Repository Structure
The project is organized into folders to keep information structured and easy to navigate:

## Folder Descriptions

### 📁 inner-planets
This folder contains text files with basic facts about the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, and Earth). Each file includes a few short facts describing the planet.

### 📁 outer-planets
This folder contains text files with facts about the outer planets (Jupiter and Saturn). These files were added later to practice making multiple commits.

### 📁 data
This folder contains structured and unstructured data files:
- **planet-stats.csv**: A CSV file containing basic statistics about several planets, including distance from the Sun, diameter, and number of moons.
- **fun-facts.txt**: A text file with interesting and fun facts about planets in the solar system.

## Fun Fact 🌟
Jupiter is so massive that it has a stronger gravitational pull than all the other planets combined, making it one of the most fascinating objects in our solar system.
